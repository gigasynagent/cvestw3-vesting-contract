# Security & Audit Information

## Audit Status

**This code has not yet undergone a formal third-party security audit.**

## Security Measures Implemented

While not formally audited, this contract incorporates several security best practices:

### ‚úÖ Security Features
- **OpenZeppelin Libraries**: Uses battle-tested OpenZeppelin contracts including:
  - `ReentrancyGuard` for protection against reentrancy attacks
  - `SafeERC20` for safe token transfers
  - `Context` for secure context access
- **Immutability**: Critical parameters (beneficiary, cliff, duration) are set at deployment and cannot be changed
- **Access Control**: Only beneficiary can release tokens
- **Input Validation**: Constructor validates that duration > cliff period
- **Overflow Protection**: Built-in SafeMath protections with Solidity 0.8.x

### ‚úÖ Testing Coverage
The full version includes comprehensive tests covering:
- Cliff period enforcement
- Linear vesting calculations
- Access control (only beneficiary can release)
- Edge cases (double release, zero amounts)
- Time-based scenarios

### üîç Self-Review Checklist
- [x] Reentrancy protection implemented
- [x] Access controls properly enforced
- [x] No floating pragma (specific version used)
- [x] Input validation in constructor
- [x] Event emissions for important actions
- [x] Safe token transfer patterns

## Recommendations for Production Use

1. **Always test on testnets first** before mainnet deployment
2. **Consider a professional audit** for large token amounts
3. **Review and understand the code** before deployment
4. **Start with small amounts** for initial testing

## Future Audit Plans

We plan to pursue formal auditing as this project grows. Check back for updates.
